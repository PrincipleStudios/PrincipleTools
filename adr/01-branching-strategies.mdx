# Branching Strategies

## Context and Problem Statement

As a consulting company, we need a recommendation for a branching strategy, or a
go-to when we start new projects. Many clients likely already have their own
strategy in place, but Principle often works faster and differently than the
teams embedded within their own company.

Each client has different restrictions, from SOX compliance, CI/CD rules, SDLC
requirements, etc. We want a branching strategy that developers can get used to
and use across most projects.

Some requirements for clients, in no particular order:

* Begin development on a future release prior to the next release being
  finalized.
* Ability to remove a feature from a release after it has been "committed." This
  can refer to either "backing out" a buggy change or simply delaying a feature
  due to an external dependency.
* Ability to move quickly and release reliably.
* Allow for manually gated approvals on releases.
* Support code reviews.
* Support multiple ongoing features/epics.

## Considered Options

* Git Flow
* GitHub Flow
* Trunk-based Development
* Scalable Git Branching Model
* Using rebase merges

## Decision Outcome

For most clients, the chosen option is the Scalable Git Branching Model, because
it can scale down to a small size to support fast-moving teams and also scale up
to handle more complex teams.

The largest drawback is onboarding and complexity; this has been mitigated with
documentation and tooling.

This can always be superceded by client decisions.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Git Flow

The [original Git Flow definition article](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
was updated in March of 2020, saying:

> Web apps are ... not the class of software that I had in mind when I wrote the
> blog post 10 years ago. If your team is doing continuous delivery of software,
> I would suggest to adopt a much simpler workflow.

* Good, because it is well known.
* Good, because it supports the idea of gated releases.
* Bad, because the development branch can get code not intended for the next
  release, requiring reverts.
* Bad, because developers need to change modes for a release. (Work on a 
  "hardening" branch.)
* Bad, because it doesn't encourage continuous integration.
* Bad, because it assumes every branch is fully feature complete.

### GitHub Flow

[GitHub Flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

* Good, because it is well known.
* Good, because it is very simple to follow.
* Good, because it supports CD.
* Bad, because it only plans for one release at a time (from the main branch).
* Bad, because it assumes every branch is fully feature complete or uses other
  solutions (like feature flags).

### Trunk based

[Trunk-based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). See also [Atlassian's Trunk-based Development recommendations](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)

* Good, because it is well known.
* Good, because it is very simple to follow.
* Good, because it enforces Continuous Integration.
* Bad, because the trunk branch can get code not intended for the next
  release, requiring reverts.
* Bad, because it either requires pre-commit hooks to check the integrity of
  each commit, or it has the potential to break every engineer's build.
* Bad, because it only plans for one release at a time (from the trunk branch).
* Bad, because only the developer gets a chance to verify before pushing. (Even
  pre-commit hooks are subject to "it works on my machine" issues.)

### Scalable Git Branching Model

[Scalable Git Branching Model](https://scaledgitflow.com/) ([dark mode](https://principlestudios.com/article/a-scalable-git-branching-model)).
See also [the breakdown of scalable options](https://tools.principlestudios.com/branching/).

* Good, because it allows for releases gated with manual steps.
* Good, because it can match GitHub Flow for the Continuous Deployment model.
* Good, because it allows for intermediate code reviews on complex features in
  the "Single Latest Version maintained" model.
* Good, because it allows for automated checks that prevent breaking the build
  for many engineers.
* Good, because it can support multiple maintained releases when necessary.
* Meh, because it encourages Continuous Integration, but doesn't enforce it.
* Bad, because it's relatively unknown.
* Bad, because it can be confusing.

### Using rebase merges

Using rebase merges, while not a fully-fleshed-out strategy on its own, can be
applied to a number of the other branching models; it can be applied to
trunk-based development quite easily, for instance. However, there are very
rarely any published models that wholly rely on rebase merging, and those that
do appear to have many of the same constraints. (citation needed)

* Good, because history appears simple for any engineers.
* Good, because it causes any merge conflicts to appear on the commit the
  rebasing engineer created.
* Bad, because once rebased it becomes very difficult to remove any code added
  to the branch.
* Bad, because it prevents recreating releases based on client changes.
* Bad, because undoing a bad conflict resolution generally requires additional
  commits on top of the bad commit (or advanced git skills).
