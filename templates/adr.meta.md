# ADR Template abstract

[The ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Template](./adr.md) is a sample starting point for implementing an ADR process.

For client projects, ADRs are recommended in lieu of another process, but not mandatory in case the client has another recommended approach.

Internal to Principle Studios, we would like to start using ADRs for individual projects and also to communicate desired architectural intent for cross-project work.

## Optional parts per project

Because of the number of optional parts, make a copy of this template for your project!

* "Deciders" - Do not include when tracked in a git repository or other system that records commentors/editors, such as Confluence.
* "Date" - Do not include when tracked in a git repository or other system that records last update date, such as Confluence.
* "Technical Story" - Include for client- or internal project-specific work

## Option parts that change per ADR

* "Decision Drivers" - Include when the decision driver is not self-evident, or if it is superceding a past ADR
* Include only one of the following:
    * "Pros and Cons of the Options" - Include this if multiple options were considered.
    * "Positive Consequences" + "Negative Consequences" - Include this if only one option was fully considered, or the opposite is self-evident.
* "Additional References" - Include if additional references are available for further reading.
