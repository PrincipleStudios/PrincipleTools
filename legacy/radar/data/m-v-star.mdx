MV-* patterns, for example MVC, MVP, and MVVM (aka Presentation Model), have been in development for decades and
continue to be relevant. Separation of concerns as applied to view layers naturally encourages moving logic to
separate layers. Modern naming of these patterns have appeared in modern UI frameworks including Angular and React,
with new names such as:

- Container components and Presentational components
- Connected components
- Smart/dumb components

Most of these follow MVP patterns, utilizing a component that contains a low-logic component to orchestrate what the
user sees.

Following these patterns continues to prove useful for test-driven development, component reuse, and with tools like
