GraphQL is an exciting alternative over a comprehensive REST-based graph API, allowing the client the flexibility to
specify exactly the fields needed. Unfortunately, there is a significant of extra boilerplate code needed with most
GraphQL frameworks. Furthermore, N+1 queries result in performance issues that are difficult to eliminate, often
requiring both client and server changes to solve.

That said, there is opportunity for GraphQL to be a successful choice for a generic web API with performance throttles
and metrics to facilitate safe use (and prevent abuse) from clients.
