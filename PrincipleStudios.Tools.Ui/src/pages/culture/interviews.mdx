I was once asked this when interviewing at a previous employer. I asked a few
questions and realized that someone had to solve the problem at some point in
the history of the team, and they'd been using it as an interview question ever
since.

Here at Principle Studios, we know that interviewing for a new job can be
intimidating, especially for software engineers. From whiteboard coding,
"gotcha" questions, and even "how would you solve this problem that we
encountered recently," there's a lot of really unpleasant interview practices
within the software engineering industry. Needless to say, we were curious if
there was a better way.

We started by looking at the goal of an interview - which, put simply, is "to
find the ideal candidate for the role." Unfortunately, that definition was too
broad to be useful. After some iteration, we arrived at four key aspects for
an ideal software engineer:

- Be aligned with our [company cultural values][1]
- Have the skills necessary to do the current job today
- Have the potential to grow to one of the best in the industry
- Be flexible enough in their work process to accomodate our clients'
  sometimes-unusual workflows

From there, we decided we wanted each interviewer to be able to focus on just
one of these aspects, and it'd be easy to find a software engineer or manager to
interview for each aspect. But, there's more to an interview than just that.

We also want to make sure new hires can work well with the other departments! As
a result, our two non-technical points (cultural values and flexible process) we
decided should be performed by non-engineers.

Maybe most importantly, we know that the best software engineers are in high
demand; as a result, we know they'll have a ton of questions for us about who we
are, what we do, and what it's like to actually work for us. As a result, our
interviews are set up to have time as for a two-way interview; we want to make
sure applicants have plenty of time to make sure that we're a good fit for them.
Our interviewers talk openly about their own experience at Principle, answering
questions as honestly as we can while still respecting NDAs of our clients.

Beyond that, each interviewer is encouraged to conduct their interview any way
they choose to be able to answer their particular question. For the technical
interviews, we've found an unusual approach that has served us quite well so
far:

- To see if a candidate has the skills we're looking for currently, we invite
  them to share code they're passionate about that they've written! We ask them
  to walk one of us through it, allowing us to ask questions and dive into the
  parts they're most excited about. Seeing another developer get excited is
  infectious for our team, and gets us to see the candidate at their best:
  worries tend to wash away and we all have a great time, knowing exactly how
  someone can fit into our existing team.
- To see if a candidate has the potential to grow, we share some of our
  (non-cient) code and treat it like an onboarding session! Since an interview
  tends to be one of the most stressful parts of our career, getting someone to
  learn while stressed gives us a great indicator of how they'll start on any
  team, but having us admit when our code isn't the best also puts them at ease.
  After a canned bit of onboarding, we let them look anywhere in that codebase,
  answering any questions or highlighting some of the parts we're most excited
  about.

The best part is that, by meeting our candidates in areas that get us all
excited, we can get past the nervousness and really see the best in each person
who applies. Sometimes we meet a great engineer and know that, while they may
not be a fit for the current position, they will be a fit in the future, and
it's not uncommon for us to reach out again later and ask if they're still
interested.

Anyway, I hope that demystifies our interview process a bit for you and
encourages just a few of you who are nervous about looking for your next career
move to reach out and see that an interview process can actually be enjoyable!
