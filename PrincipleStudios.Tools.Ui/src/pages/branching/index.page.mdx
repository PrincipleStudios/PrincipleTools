# Branching Strategies

Principle engineering primarily recommends the thought process behind [scalable git branching model][1], though that
post is written more as an overview than a guide on how to implement it for any specific project. The primary scenarios
we see (from simplest to most complex) are:

1. Rapid Prototyping or Continuous Deployment of a web site

    When the team is very small (one or two engineers), or code is to be continuously deployed, follow this process
    with one service line where feature branches also act as release candidates. (This is what this site uses.)

2. [Single latest version maintained](./single-latest-version/)

    With gated releases such as release trains, manual approvals, etc., a more advanced process is needed. We use only
    one service line, called "main", but use every other branch type from the original document. (This is what 
    Principle recommends for the majority of our projects and clients.)

3. Multiple maintained versions

    When supporting on-premise deployed applications or open source libraries, back versions need to be maintained. In
    these scenarios, the full branching model is used, tracking each maintained version with a separate service line
    and keeping them all up-to-date.

# Principles

Here are a few principles to keep in mind when working with these branching models. We're aware that every project has
its own needs, so keep these in mind when tweaking the process to make it your own.

## Isolation until Finalized

Code that is a work-in-progress usually needs to be tested before merging. Even with rapid prototyping, we prefer to
use feature branches to assist with code reviews and ensure feature flags are in place before merging.

## Multiple Bases

Each branch may have more than one branch from which it is created, referred to as its base branches. This happens less
frequently in the simpler scenarios.

## Immediate Downstream Propagation

When any of a branch's base branches is updated, the base branch should be re-merged into the branch. Keeping branches
up to date with their base branches is important for continuous integration in lieu of a development branch where all
features are continuously integrated.

# Additional things to keep in mind

Also known as our "secondary principles", these extra guidelines will keep everything clean and working smoothly.

## No Upstream Propagation

Do not merge branches into their base branch until the branch is to be deleted.

## No Branch is Sacred

Other than the "main" branch in the simpler workflows, any branch that gets bad data in it can simply be removed and
recreated. Once merged into a service line, branches should be removed.

> Branches that remain for an extended period eventually become stale or need to be "refreshed" manually, so do not use
> a branch to track what is on a particular environment, at least not by merging into the branch. Resetting the branch
> to track a release candidate is acceptable, but it may as well be a tag at that point.

## Move Infrastructure Out

Engineering work, such as refactoring or building shared components, should be done as their own branches, whether as
features or infrastructure branches. This way when another engineer needs the shared component in their branch, they
can immediately merge it in, adding a new base to their branch, and start using it - without added risk of bringing a
feature that may not be deployable for some time.
