# Continuous Deployment

The Continuous Deployment approach to the [scalable git branching model][1] is common for teams working on web
applications with continuous deployment, but it's also useful for scaling down for small teams with only a developer or
two, such as during the rapid prototyping phase of a project.

## Branch Types

Every branch type below documents:

- an example regular expression for a naming convention for the branches,
- one or more example branch names, and
- the branch types that can be used to create and update these branches.

### Main Branch

As our only service line, the `main` branch (or `trunk`) represents the most recently deployed code. For any new work,
it is safe to use `main` as the base branch.

- **Example Regex**: `^main$`
- **Example Names**: `main`
- **Based on**: N/A. Main only gets updated after approval of a feature.

### Feature Branches

These represent the basic unit of business work. Most feature branches are based on the main branch, but they may
include infrastructure branches.

> Depending on the project, bugs may be treated as features or they may be treated as sub-tasks for a particular
> feature. The examples provided allow for both, but bugs reported in a feature branch should be based on the
> feature(s) they originate from.

When features are ready to release, they are tested directly, and the feature branch is merged to `main` and deployed
when it is approved for production.

- **Example Regex**: `^(feature|bugfix)/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+(-[^/]+)?$`
- **Example Names**: `feature/ABC-1234`, `feature/ABC-1235-manage-profile-picture`, `bugfix/XYZ-78-update-email-validation`
- **Based on**: Main. In some cases can be based infrastructure branches.

#### Sub-feature Branches

Often, features can be broken down into smaller tasks and tracked within your ticketing system. If features are large
enough to be broken down further, these branches may be used to have a more granular visibility into work, allowing for
easier reviews, simpler testing, and even small experiments.

Once a sub-feature is merged into its parent feature, the sub-feature branch should be deleted.

- **Example Regex**: `^(feature|bugfix)/([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)(_[A-Z]+-[0-9]+)+(-[^/]+)?$`
- **Example Names**: `feature/ABC-1234_ABC-1237`, `feature/ABC-1235_ABC-1236-support-webp`, `bugfix/XYZ-78_XYZ-79-better-email-regex`
  - _Note: Because git uses file paths, slashes cannot delimit each ticket name without conflicting with comment-free
    feature branches._
- **Based on**: Parent feature.

### Less-common branch types

The following branch types are not used in all projects.

#### Infrastructure branches

Some projects do not track technical investments, such as refactoring and additional shared components, as features.
When not tracked, engineers should put shared infrastructure in one of these infrastructure branches. Engineers may
add an infrastructure branch as a base for their features; the shared commits between the infrastructure will reach
main when the first feature that includes it is released.

- **Example Regex**: `^infra/`
- **Example Names**: `infra/button-component`, `infra/refactor-plugin-api`, `infra/update-typescript`
- **Based on**: Main, or other infrastructure branches when necessary.

## Standard processes

Most engineers should be used to creating a feature branch from `main`, and a sub-feature branch from the feature
branch. When any base branch is updated, engineers should update the downstream branch, keeping it up-to-date.

### Releases

Once a feature is approved to go to production:

- Merge it to `main`
- Delete its base branches recursively, including infrastructure branches.

## Automation and Branch policies

- Subfeatures and features should have checks run, such as unit tests, builds, type checks, linting, etc.
- Features with pull requests to main should be deployed to testing environments.
- Main should only be merged from features with approval from QA and should be deployed automatically to production.
