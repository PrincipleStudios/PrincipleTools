# Single Latest Version

The Single Latest Version approach to the [scalable git branching model][1] is common for teams working on web
applications where only a single version is maintained - the most recently deployed codebase.

## Branch Types

Every branch type below documents:
* an example regular expression for a naming convention for the branches,
* one or more example branch names, and
* the branch types that can be used to create and update these branches.

### Main Branch

As our only service line, the `main` branch (or `trunk`) represents the most recently deployed code. For any new work,
it is safe to use `main` as the base branch.

* **Example Regex**: `^main$`
* **Example Names**: `main`
* **Based on**: N/A. Main only gets updated via Release Candidates.

### Feature Branches

These represent the basic unit of business work that can be included in a release. Most feature branches are based on
the main branch, but they may also be based on other feature branches, and they may include infrastructure branches.

> Depending on the project, bugs may be treated as features or they may be treated as sub-tasks for a particular
> feature. The examples provided allow for both, but bugs reported in a feature branch should be based on the
> feature(s) they originate from.

* **Example Regex**: `^(feature|bugfix)/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+(-[^/]+)?$`
* **Example Names**: `feature/ABC-1234`, `feature/ABC-1235-manage-profile-picture`, `bugfix/XYZ-78-update-email-validation`
* **Based on**: Main. In some cases can be based on other feature branches, infrastructure branches.

#### Sub-feature Branches

Often, features can be broken down into smaller tasks to be worked by different engineers and tracked within your
ticketing system. If features are large enough to be broken down further, these branches may be used to have a more
granular visibility into work, allowing for easier reviews, simpler testing, and even small experiments.

* **Example Regex**: `^(feature|bugfix)(/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+){2,}(-[^/]+)?$`
* **Example Names**: `feature/ABC-1234/ABC-1237`, `feature/ABC-1235/ABC-1236-support-webp`, `bugfix/XYZ-78/XYZ-79-better-email-regex`
* **Based on**: Parent feature, or parent integration branch.

### Release Candidates

When features are ready to release, they are bundled into a release candidate. For the most part, this is merging the
features together into a branch for deployment and testing, keeping them separate from `main` in case production needs
a hot fix or a feature needs to be pulled from the release.

Do not resolve merge conflicts from merging two features into a release candidate when creating the release candidate;
instead, create an integration branch.

Bugs found in a release candidate should be fixed within the originating branch, or an integration branch that contains
the features that caused the bug. Bug fixes should not be branched from the release candidate if at all possible; doing
so will hinder the ability to rebuild the release candidate if a feature needs to be removed.

If a feature needs to be removed from a release candidate, rather than trying to revert commits, a fresh release
candidate should be made from the features still preserved.

* **Example Regex**: `^rc/[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}(\.[0-9]+)?$`
* **Example Names**: `rc/2022-07-14`, `rc/2022-07-14.1`
* **Based on**: Main (or a pending release candidate) and one or more feature branches

### Integration branches

Sometimes, two features are targetted for the same release but have conflicts with each other. Whether found via merge
conflicts or from bugs resulting from conflicting logic, integration branches are used for resolving integration
issues.

* **Example Regex**: `^integrate(/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+){2,}$`; by convention, tickets get alphabetically ordered
* **Example Names**: `integrate/ABC-1234/ABC-1235`, `integrate/ABC-1234/ABC-1235/XYZ-78`
* **Based on**: Two or more feature branches

### Less-common branch types

The following branch types are not used in all projects.

#### Hotfixes

Some projects, when discovering an issue in production, have a need to track fixes separately from a standard feature
and release candidate process. Hotfix branches act as a combination of Feature and Release Candidates; they have
developer changes, but may be treated as a release candidate for testing and releases.

* **Example Regex**: `^hotfix/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+(-[^/]+)?$`
* **Example Names**: `hotfix/FF-2`, `hotfix/FF-3-fix-db-pooling`
* **Based on**: Main

#### Infrastructure branches

Some projects do not track technical investments, such as refactoring and additional shared components, as features.
When not tracked, engineers should put shared infrastructure in one of these infrastructure branches. Engineers may
add an infrastructure branch as a base for their features; the shared commits between the infrastructure will reach
main when the first feature that includes it is released.

* **Example Regex**: `^infra/`
* **Example Names**: `infra/button-component`, `infra/refactor-plugin-api`, `infra/update-typescript`
* **Based on**: Main, or other infrastructure branches when necessary.

## Standard processes

Most engineers should be used to creating a feature branch from `main`, and a sub-feature branch from the feature
branch. When any base branch is updated, engineers should update the downstream branch, keeping it up-to-date.

### Releases

Once a release candidate is approved to go to production:

* Merge it to `main`
* Delete its base branches recursively, including infrastructure branches.

### Re-integrating integration branches

If all but one of the base branches of an integration branch is merged to main, the integration branch may be merged
into its other base. This will resolve merge conflicts between the released features and the unreleased features
without needing to re-do the conflict resolution.

## Automation and Branch policies

* Subfeatures and features should have checks run, such as unit tests, builds, type checks, linting, etc.
* Release candidates and hotfixes should be deployed to testing environments. Release candidates should only be built
  from feature branches, with no revert commits or conflict resolution.
* Main should only be merged from release candidates with approval from QA and should be deployed automatically to production.
