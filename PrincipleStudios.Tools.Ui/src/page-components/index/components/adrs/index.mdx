# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs are a technique used to capture architecture decisions along with the
context at the time they were made in order to solve the long-term problem of
architectural drift.

ADRs listed below are listed most-recent first; we&rsquo;ll work to expand our
listing in the future to sort by category.
