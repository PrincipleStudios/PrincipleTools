title: Loadable
---

A simple structure indicating a value that may be loaded, but also encapsulates
a range of intermediate states, including:

- Not yet loading
- Error states
- Loading with previous value
- Loading with no previous value

Useful when wrapping libraries for future compatability and interop across
project boundaries.
