AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a good solution for running containers in AWS, but has several fundamental
differences between it and other standard Kubernetes services on other platforms (such as Azure) that make it behave
in unexpected ways, including ingress and permissions. As a result, we recommend Kubernetes offerings from other
providers, but EKS is still a viable option if a project requires both Kubernetes and AWS.
