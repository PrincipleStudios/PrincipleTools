React is lightweight enough to be used as a view layer with other frameworks, especially when in the process of
migrating to React. (See [MV-*](/radar/quadrant/techniques/#m-v-star).)

*June 24, 2022:* Principle's Anthony Pileggi gave an internal demo using a combination of React 18,
Angular 13, and [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc), using Angular services and rxjs to pass state between the
components.
