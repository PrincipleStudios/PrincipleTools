[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a tool to build components and share as a library in isolation from the main
application has shown promise in a number of our projects. Storybook works best when keeping the view layer separate
from the application logic, following [MV-*](/radar/quadrant/techniques/#m-v-star) patterns.

However, Storybook has a significant number of dependencies, including reliance on specific versions of other libraries.
